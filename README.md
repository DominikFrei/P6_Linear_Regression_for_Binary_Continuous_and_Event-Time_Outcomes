# P6_Linear_Regression_for_Binary_Continuous_and_Event-Time_Outcomes

## Abstract

The aim of this work was to get some intuition about linear regression. Three different
data sets where used (titanic, mtcars, lung) and different types of data where used 
as dependent variable:  
- Titanic: Survival (Binary)  
- mtcars: mpg (Miles per Gallon; Continuous)  
- lung: Survival(-time) (Time-Event Data)  

Simple regression models where fit using different data types (binary, categorical, 
continuous) as independent variables. The results where interpreted and the model 
assumptions where checked.  
Then multiple linear regression models where fit, using combinations of the independent
variables used to fit the simple regression models. It was assessed if there is confounding
or effect modification between the independent variables. Here too, the results where 
interpreted and the model assumptions where checked.

Finally, in the cases where more independent variables where available, the best model 
was searched for.

## What I learned

- (Multiple) Linear Regression: Fitting models, interpreting their results, assessing if there is
significant confounding or effect modification, check the model assumptions
- (Multiple) Logistic Regression: Fitting models, interpreting their results, assessing if there is
significant confounding or effect modification, check the model assumptions
- (Multiple) Cox Regression: Fitting models, interpreting their results, assessing if there is
significant confounding or effect modification, check the model assumptions

## What could be improved

- The linearity assumption for logistic regression remains a bit unclear to me  

## Duration

- R: 41 h
